What Are Media Queries?

Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width).

CSS media queries are part of the CSS cascade, and therefore go at the bottom of your CSS page, below the rest of your CSS.

Media queries are used when you want to make specific CSS changes when the screen width hits certain points.

These are called "breakpoints" - think of the phrase in terms of when your design breaks, IE, when it looks bad. 

Maybe a headline looked great on a thin screen, but on a wide screen it looks awful. Or maybe an image looks great on a wide screen, but is huge on a tiny screen. 

Solving these problems is where media queries come in.

When you take a look at a page in Chrome dev tools you can watch how the CSS style(s) of an HTML element change when the screen width hits certain points.

The standard is to let your eyes tell you when something is broken; that said, the widths at which I typically design my layouts with media queries in mind are as follows (note: this is not an exhaustive list.)

375
414
425
640
768
992
1024
1120
1200
1366
1440
1600
1920

I use Google Chrome Devtools with the Device Toolbar toggled on, and adjust it at the above sizes to see if my design needs tweaking at any of those points.

Media Query Syntax:

first, add your media query parameters, EG:

@media (min-width: 414px)

follow that with open and closing curly braces

{

}

between those add your CSS rules, as usual. 

For example, these following lines change the width 
of a particular image *only* when the screen's 
minimum width is 640px:

@media (min-width: 640px)
{
  img.main-image
  {   
    width: 154px;
    height: 456px;
  }
}

Some samples follow.

/*
Assume you have the following in your custom.css, as before:
*/

iframe#mapid
{   
  width: 140px;
  height: 400px;
}

/*
Then in your media queries you can over-write it when certain conditions are met:
*/

@media (min-width: 414px)
{
  iframe#mapid
  {   
    width: 154px;
    height: 456px;
  }
}


@media (min-width: 640px)
{
  iframe#mapid
  {   
    width: 224px;
    height: 336px;
  }
}


@media (min-width: 768px)
{
  iframe#mapid
  {   
    width: 314px;
  }
}


@media (min-width: 992px)
{
  iframe#mapid
  {   
    width: 430px;
  }
}


@media (min-width: 1200px)
{
  iframe#mapid
  {   
    width: 520px;
  }
}
