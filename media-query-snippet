CSS media queries are part of the CSS cascade, and therefore go at the bottom of your CSS page, below the rest of your CSS.

Media queries are used when you want to make specific CSS changes when the screen width hits certain points.

These are called "breakpoints" - think of the phrase in terms of when your design breaks, IE, when it looks bad. 

Maybe a headline looked great on a thin screen, but on a wide screen it looks awful. Or maybe an image looks great on a wide screen, but is huge on a tiny screen. 

Solving these problems is where media queries come in.

When you take a look at a page in Chrome dev tools you can watch how the map's width changes when the screen width hits certain points.

The standard is to let your eyes tell you when something is broken; that said, the widths at which I typically design my layouts with media queries in mind are as follows (note: this is not an exhaustive list.)

375
414
425
640
768
992
1024
1120
1200
1366
1440
1600
1920

I use Google Chrome Devtools with the Device Toolbar toggled on, and adjust it at the above sizes to see if my design needs tweaking at any of those points.
