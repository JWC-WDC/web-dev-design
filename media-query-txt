Create a website as before using our classwork. Keep it basic while you're learning this technique - I suggest you start with bootstrap-starter-file-html and bootstrap-starter-file-css

NOTES
There is a video you can see here describing the media query process. Throughout much of the video I added a light gray border to every DIV, so you can get a sense of your DIV boundaries when setting widths. I this example, we are setting the default width and height of an iframe, and then changing those values based on the changing width of the screen (aka, viewport.)

The video is here: VIMEO

GENERAL STEPS
-paste the iframe embed code wherever you want it in your HTML

-strip the hard-coded (aka, inline) CSS from the iframe embed code

-give the iframe an ID name, in this example, "main_audio"

-create a style for that iframe in your custom.css, setting its default width and height

-create CSS media queries to adjust the height & width of this iframe at specific breakpoints

Here is a default iframe embed for testing:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZbcIVTuHKQ?start=60" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
