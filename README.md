Code snippets for class web projects.

Remember: your top-level project folder should have sub-folders for images, CSS and more. A proper beginning structure would look like:

/project-name/<br/>
/project-name/index.html<br/>
/project-name/contact.html<br/><br/>
/project-name/css/<br/>
/project-name/css/custom.css<br/><br/>
/project-name/images/<br/>
/project-name/images/logo.png

etc.

Create that directory strcture, if needed. 

Then create an empty index.html in it as well as an empty /css/custom.css file.

Then paste the sections of code from this site into those pages as needed. 

For example:

HTML:
bootstrap-starter-file

CSS:
css-starter-file

Remember:

1. always sketch your layouts first
2. based on such a sketch, use the code here on GitHub as a starting framework to building great flexible grid-based layouts using Bootstrap
3. once such a framework is built, populate it with content, including but not limited to, snippets from this GitHub page
4. get it all working 1st before you start modifying CSS - you can plan it out, but don't add/change styles until everything works
5. don't forget to test and re-test every step of the way - using Google Chrome as your browser
