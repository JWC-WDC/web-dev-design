Code snippets for class web projects.

Remember: your top-level project folder should have sub-folders for images, CSS and more. A proper beginning structure would look like:

/project-01/<br/>
/project-01/index.html<br/><br/>
/project-01/css/<br/>
/project-01/css/custom.css<br/><br/>
/project-01/images/<br/>
/project-01/images/logo.png

etc.
