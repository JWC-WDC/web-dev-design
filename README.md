Code snippets for class web projects.

Remember: your top-level project folder should have sub-folders for images, CSS and more. A proper beginning structure would look like:

/project1/<br/>
/project1/index.html<br/><br/>
/project1/css/<br/>
/project1/css/custom.css<br/><br/>
/project1/images/<br/>
/project1/images/logo.png

etc.

Create that directory strcture, if needed. 

Then create an empty index.html in it as well as an empty /css/custom.css file.

Then paste the sections of code from this site into those pages as needed. 

For example:

HTML:
bootstrap-starter-file

CSS:
css-starter-file
