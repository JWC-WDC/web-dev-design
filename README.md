# web-dev-design
Code snippets for class web projects.

Remember: your top-level project folder should have sub-folders for images, CSS and more. A proper beginning structure would look like:

/project1/<br/>
/project1/index.html<br/><br/>
/project1/css/<br/>
/project1/css/custom.css<br/><br/>
/project1/images/<br/>
/project1/images/logo.png

etc.
