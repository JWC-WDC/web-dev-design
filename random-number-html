		// WHAT IS OUR GOAL WITH THIS PAGE? ///////////////////////////////////////////

		// We want to show a *different* CSS design with 100% the *same* HTML content each time the page loads.

		// To do this, we'll get a random number picked by JavaScript when the HTML page loads.

		// Then, based on that number, we'll load a different CSS stylesheet into the same HTML page also using JavaScript. 

		// (REMEMBER: The following is an introduction, the concepts will be elaborated upon in coming weeks.)

		///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

		// First, we tell the HTML page to "listen" as the page loads, and then to run the following script(s) once it knows the page has loaded

		// The script is saying, Watch for when the page finishes loading

		// nce the  

		// Note the "function(){}"

		// elab

		document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(){
			

		///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

		// First, we pick a random number between 1 and 6.

		// Then we assign that number as the value of the variable "myNumber"

		// Think of a "variable" as a container such as a bag holding a sandwich, or a grocery list holding dinner items, or a glass holding liquid.

		// In other words, a variable (or "var") holds something. 

			// For example, a glass could hold water, wine or beer. In this case, our var ("myNumber") will hold the random number picked when the page loads. Again, think of a variable as a *container*, holding something.

			// To get a random number, we use the JavaScript Math object which allows us to perform mathematical tasks on numbers, such as adding or subtracting or in this case, choosing a random number.

			// In this example, we'll use the JS Math object 2x: 

			// 1. First we use "Math.random()" to pick a random number between 1 and 6. 

			// 2. Then "Math.floor()" gives us the largest integer less than or equal to a given number. In our case, this is the value of "myNumber". 

			// For example, "Math.floor()" turns a "6.95" into a "6". (In this tutorial, I am using the number 6 as an example, any integer will do.)

			// PLEASE NOTE: in the line of code we're discussing, shown below, do you see how one Math task is placed *inside* another one? 

			// Note how JavaScript uses parentheses to order the Math operations. What's in the parenthese gets calculated first, inside-out, like you porbably learned in math class.

			// Behind the scenes, then, JavaScript processes this line like this:

			// FIRST it choose a random number b/w 1 and 6; THEN it rounds that number off; THEN it assigns the rounded-off number as the value of the var "myNumber":

			var myNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);


			///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


			// Now that we have our random number as the value of the "myNumber" variable, we'll use a JavaScript switch() statement to do something, based on what that number is.

			// Here, we'll use a switch() statement to analyze that value and based on it, create another variable called "myStyle" and assign it a value, specifically - the full name and path of a CSS file.

			// For example, if the value of "myNumber" is 1, then the variable "myStyle" (below) will have a value of "http://www.csszengarden.com/218/218.css?v=8may2013". 

			// If it is a 3, the "myStyle" value will be for a different CSS file. 

			// Note: What if there is no value, or a value outside the range? Then the default is used automatically. In this example, the value of "myStyle" would be the css/custom.css file.

			// Finally, the last line (console.log(myStyle)) displays the result of the switch() operation in the console on your browser, so you can confirm that the switch() is creating the variable you want.

			// As always, make sure you have Chrome DevTools open to see it.

			switch (myNumber) {				
				case 1:
				var myStyle = 'http://www.csszengarden.com/218/218.css?v=8may2013';
				console.log(myStyle);
				break;

				case 2:
				var myStyle = 'http://www.csszengarden.com/220/220.css?v=8may2013';
				console.log(myStyle);
				break;

				case 3:
				var myStyle = 'http://www.csszengarden.com/216/216.css?v=8may2013';
				console.log(myStyle);
				break;

				case 4:
				var myStyle = 'http://www.csszengarden.com/215/215.css?v=8may2013';
				console.log(myStyle);
				break;

				case 5:
				var myStyle = 'http://www.csszengarden.com/221/221.css?v=8may2013';
				console.log(myStyle);
				break;

				default:
				var myStyle = 'css/custom.css';
				console.log(myStyle);
			}



			///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


			// now that we have a CSS page to load (that is, the value of "myStyle"), let's append the CSS file into our HTML via JavaScript:

			var fileref = document.createElement("link");
			fileref.rel = "stylesheet";
			fileref.type = "text/css";
			fileref.href = myStyle;
			document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(fileref)
		
		} // this closes the function run by the addEventListener
		
		); // this closes the addEventListener itself

				<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
				<p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
				<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>
				<p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

				<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
				<p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
				<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="participation" id="zen-participation" role="article">
				<h3>Participation</h3>
				<p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/" title="A listing of CSS-related resources"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
				<p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
				<p>Download the sample <a href="/examples/index" title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified.">HTML</a> and <a href="/examples/style.css" title="This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify.">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don&#8217;t submit half-finished work) upload your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server under your control. <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/" title="Use the contact form to send us your CSS file">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
				<p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
				<p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
				<p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
